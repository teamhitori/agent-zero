### document_artifact
create/open/read/edit reusable document artifacts in Agent Zero
formats: md odt ods odp docx xlsx pptx
default format: md
actions: create open read edit inspect export version_history restore_version status
common args: action kind title format content path file_id operation find replace
optional UI intent args: open_in_canvas open_in_desktop
create/read/edit results save or update artifacts only; they do not open a surface automatically unless the user explicitly asks to open the document UI
Markdown opens in the Editor surface; ODT/ODS/ODP/DOCX/XLSX/PPTX open in Desktop
use action `open`, `open_in_canvas: true`, or `open_in_desktop: true` only when the user explicitly asks to open the document/editor/Desktop
for action `edit`, use operation and put append/prepend/set text in `content` (example: operation `append_text`, content "new line")
after create/edit, answer briefly with what changed and the saved path when useful; do not write faux UI action labels like "Open document" or "Download file"
do not add a note saying the canvas/document UI was not opened automatically unless the user explicitly asks about UI behavior
ODF is first-class for LibreOffice: use ODT for Writer, ODS for Spreadsheet/Calc, and ODP for Presentation/Impress unless the user explicitly requests OOXML compatibility
DOCX/XLSX/PPTX are compatibility formats, not defaults
XLSX charts: use edit operation `create_chart` with `chart` object instead of code execution for embedded spreadsheet charts when an embedded chart is required
chart types: line bar column pie area scatter stock ohlc candlestick
ODS/XLSX create/edit tabular content: CSV, TSV, Markdown tables, or rows arrays become real spreadsheet cells
for nontrivial document artifact work, load skill `document-artifacts` or the specific Markdown/Writer/Calc/Impress skill first
